# ansible-test-gh-action for setting up CI in Ansible Collection repositories

A composite GitHub Action encapsulating the GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows
setup necessary for testing Ansible collection repositories on GitHub.


## Usage

To use the action add the following step to your workflow file (e.g.
`.github/workflows/ansible-test.yml`)

```yaml
- name: Perform integration testing with ansible-test
  uses: ansible-community/ansible-test-gh-action@release/v1
  with:
    ansible-core-version: stable-2.14
    pre-test-cmd: echo This runs before the ansible-test invocation
    target-python-version: 3.11
    controller-python-version: auto
    testing-type: integration
    test-deps: ansible.netcommon
- name: Perform sanity testing with ansible-test
  uses: ansible-community/ansible-test-gh-action@release/v1
  with:
    ansible-core-version: stable-2.14
    testing-type: sanity
- name: Perform unit testing with ansible-test
  uses: ansible-community/ansible-test-gh-action@release/v1
  with:
    ansible-core-version: stable-2.14
    pre-test-cmd: echo This runs before the ansible-test invocation
    target-python-version: 3.11
    testing-type: units
    test-deps: >-
      ansible.netcommon
      ansible.utils
```

> **Pro tip**: instead of using branch pointers, like `main`, pin
versions of Actions that you use to tagged versions or SHA-1 commit
identifiers. This will make your workflows more secure and better
reproducible, saving you from sudden and unpleasant surprises.


## Options


### `ansible-core-version`

`ansible-core` Git revision. See https://github.com/ansible/ansible/tags
and https://github.com/ansible/ansible/branches/all?query=stable- for
ideas. The repository this refers to can be changed with the
`ansible-core-github-repository-slug` option. **(DEFAULT: `stable-2.14`)**


### `ansible-core-github-repository-slug`

The GitHub repository slug from which to check out ansible-core
**(DEFAULT: `ansible/ansible`)**


### `controller-python-version`

Controller Python version. This is only used for integration tests and
ansible-core 2.12 or later when `target-python-version` is also specified
**(DEFAULT: `auto`)**


### `codecov-token`

The Codecov token to use when uploading coverage data. **(OPTIONAL)**


### `collection-root`

Path to collection root relative to repository root **(DEFAULT: `.`)**


### `collection-src-directory`

A pre-checked out collection directory that's already on disk
**(OPTIONAL, substitutes getting the source from the remote Git
repository if set, also this action will not attempt to mutate
its contents)**


### `coverage`

Whether to collect and upload coverage information. Can be set to
`always`, `never`, and `auto`. The value `auto` will upload coverage
information except when `pull-request-change-detection` is set to `true`
and the action is called from a Pull Request. **(DEFAULT: `auto`)**

> [!NOTE]
> Coverage is only generated for modules and plugins. If your collection does
> not contain any modules or plugins, set this to `never` to avoid errors in
> the codecov upload step due to no coverage information being available.


### `docker-image`

A container image spawned by `ansible-test` **(OPTIONAL)**


### `git-checkout-ref`

Committish to check out, unused if `collection-src-directory`
is set **(OPTIONAL)**


### `integration-continue-on-error`

Whether the continue with the other integration tests when an error occurs.
If set to `false`, will stop on the first error. When set to `false` and
`coverage=auto`, code coverage uploading will be disabled.
**(DEFAULT: `true`)**


### `integration-diff`

Whether to show diff output when calling actions in integration tests.
Actions can override this by specifying `diff: false` or `diff: true`.
**(DEFAULT: `true`)**


### `integration-retry-on-error`

Whether to retry the current integration test once when an error happens.
**(DEFAULT: `true`)**


### `origin-python-version`

Environment Python version. The value `auto` uses the maximum Python
version supported by the given `ansible-core-version` **(DEFAULT: `auto`)**


### `pre-test-cmd`

Extra command to invoke before ansible-test **(OPTIONAL)**


### `pull-request-change-detection`

Whether to use change detection for pull requests. If set to `true`, will
use change detection to determine changed files against the target branch,
and will not upload code coverage results. If the invocation is not from a
pull request, this option is ignored. Note that this requires
`collection-src-directory` to be empty, or it has to be a git repository
checkout where `collection-src-directory`/`collection-root` ends with
`ansible_collections/{namespace}/{name}`, or it has to be a git
repository checkout where `collection-root` is `.`. **(DEFAULT: `false`)**


### `python-version`

**(DEPRECATED)** Use `origin-python-version` instead.


### `target`

`ansible-test` TARGET **(OPTIONAL)**


### `target-python-version`

Target Python version **(OPTIONAL)**


### `testing-type`

`ansible-test` subcommand **(REQUIRED, Must be one of 'sanity', 'units'
or 'integration')**


### `test-deps`

Test dependencies to install along with this collection **(OPTIONAL)**


## Outputs


### `ansible-playbook-executable`

Path to the auto-installed `ansible-playbook` executable


### `ansible-test-executable`

Path to the auto-installed `ansible-test` executable


### `checkout-directory`

Path to the auto-downloaded collection src directory


### `collection-fqcn`

Detected collection FQCN


### `collection-name`

Detected collection name


### `collection-namespace`

Detected collection namespace


### `origin-python-path`

The [`python-path` output value][`python-path`] of the [setup-python] action


### `origin-python-version`

The actual value of `origin-python-version` passed to the [setup-python] action


### `sanity-tests`

Comma-separated list of sanity tests to run. If not present, all applicable tests are run.


### `sanity-skip-tests`

Comma-separated list of sanity tests to skip.


### `sanity-allow-disabled`

Allow running sanity tests that are disabled by default.
**(DEFAULT: `false`)**
